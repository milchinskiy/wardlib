# About

**wardlib** is an external extension of
[Ward](https://github.com/milchinskiy/ward)'s "standard library".

Ward ships with a small core set of modules. **wardlib** lives outside the Ward
repository and exists to:

- provide additional batteries (modules, helpers, utilities),
- experiment and iterate faster than core,
- give the community a shared place to publish and maintain extensions.
